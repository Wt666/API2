Now we can write a simple loop to count the words in any text we want
to analyze. We do this by storing the names of the files we want to analyze
in a list, and then we call count_words() for each file in the list. We’ll try to
count the words for Alice in Wonderland, Siddhartha, Moby Dick, and Little
Women, which are all available in the public domain. I’ve intentionally left
siddhartha.txt out of the directory containing word_count.py, so we can see
how well our program handles a missing file:
def count_words(filename):
--snip--
filenames = ['alice.txt', 'siddhartha.txt', 'moby_dick.txt', 'little_women.txt']
for filename in filenames:
count_words(filename)
The missing siddhartha.txt file has no effect on the rest of the program’s
execution:
The file alice.txt has about 29465 words.
Sorry, the file siddhartha.txt does not exist.
The file moby_dick.txt has about 215830 words.
The file little_women.txt has about 189079 words.
